I ran through the twilight flats with Will, the order of u, y, OIII, Ha, SII, z, i, r, g seems optimal. i is about 2-3 times as bright as z, so there's a time buffer there. i and r are about the same for throughput at twilight.

My notes follow: count values are for the initial flat in each series. Flats should be in  scratch/Manual Operation/Flats/<today's date>

u @ -3 deg, 30s gave somewhat low counts, but acceptable <br>
OIII @ -3.65 deg, 5s 26000 counts <br>
y @ -4 deg, 8s, 11500 counts <br>
Ha @ -4.35 deg, 6s, 13000 counts <br>
SII @ -4.63 deg, 8s, 14000 counts <br>
z @ -4.92 deg, 6s, 27000 counts <br>
i @ -5.3 deg, 5s, 50000 counts <br>
break <br>
i @ -5.87 deg, 5s, 25000 counts <br>
r @ -6.17 deg, 5s, 15500 counts <br>
g @ -6.48 deg, 5s, 19000 counts <br>

u flats started at 10s @-1.6 degrees sun elevation 4x gain, giving about 20000 counts.

OIII flats can start at 1x gain mode around -2.5 degrees elevation, 5s <br>
y 2x 5s -2.8 deg gives 13000 counts <br>
did SII and Ha out of range (used 2x 5s) <br>
z 1x -3.85 5s 25000 counts <br>
i 1x @ -5 deg 5s <br>
r 1x @ -5.4 deg 5s <br>
g 2x @ -5.67 deg 5s too bright, waited -5.8 deg 5s <br>
red 2x 7s @ -6 deg <br>
green 4x 7s <br>
blue -6.63 deg 8s 4x 20000 counts <br>
lum end at -7.1 s 4x 5s <br>

From what I am best able to piece together of the flats we have they should be taken in this order (starting with the ones that take the most time and require the most light):

y, oii, ha, sii, z, i, r, g.

(I'm not totally sure as I don't have super consistent data to compare but hopefully this is helpful as a starting point to at least try to get them) - I still need to look at the grisms
